These are the steps we might have to do for getting the system up and running.

1. Install k3s https://docs.k3s.io/installation/configuration
2. Install Rancher via helm chart https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/getting-started/installation-and-upgrade/install-upgrade-on-a-kubernetes-cluster
3. In Rancher UI:
  Under App -> Repositories:
    - Add bitnami chart url https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
4. Under App -> Charts search and install the following apps:
  - Clickhouse.
    - By default it deployes 3 replicas. Need to configure to deploy only one replica (probably if possible all in one pod)
  - flink
  - kafka
	Mongo DB
	- Redis
	
5. Install rancher monitoring.
6. Install Docker registry. Need to create a deployment yaml . Also need to configure k3s https://docs.k3s.io/installation/private-registry with registry url.
7. May be need to install cert-manager (https://charts.jetstack.io helm repo)
8. Need to create deployment yaml for application pods.

Note:
â€¢	Bitnami charts provides configurations to select resource profiles (like small, nano, medium etc.) . In case of resource issues like cpu / memory , need to tweak the resource profiles of the applications while installing.

There should not be much issue in these steps and should be simple to setup. I have faced lots of issues while setting up jenkins and CI/CD.
